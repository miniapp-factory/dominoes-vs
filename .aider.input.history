+Code the following app
+```
+Mini App Description
+
+Develop a multiplayer domino game (1v1 or 2v2) where:
+
+The user connects their Web3 wallet (e.g., Coinbase Wallet, MetaMask)
+
+Each game costs US$0.02 in Ethereum (ETH on Base Chain)
+
+The player uses an in-game currency
+
+There is a competitive ranking system
+
+The app functions as a Base Mini App
+
+🔗 Blockchain & Smart Contracts
+
+Blockchain: Base Chain
+
+Contract Language: Solidity
+
+Main Contract Functions:
+
+Automatically charge US$0.02 in ETH at the start of each game
+
+Use a price oracle (e.g., Chainlink) to convert USD → ETH
+
+Manage the in-game currency balance
+
+Record:
+
+Wins
+
+Losses
+
+Score
+
+Update on-chain or hybrid ranking (on-chain +  Off-chain)
+
+Distribute in-game currency rewards to winners
+
+💰 Game Economy
+
+Fee per match: US$ 0.02 in ETH
+
+In-game currency (ERC-20 or internal logic):
+
+Earned by winning matches
+
+Can be used for:
+
+Entering ranked matches
+
+Purchasing cosmetic items (future)
+
+Part of the fee may go to:
+
+Prize pool
+
+Project treasury
+
+🏆 Ranking System
+
+Ranking based on:
+
+Number of wins
+
+ELO score or similar system
+
+Display:
+
+Top 100 players
+
+Current player position
+
+Automatic update after each match
+
+Weekly/monthly ranking option
+
+🎮 Game Mechanics (Dominoes)
+
+Classic dominoes (double-six or double-nine)
+
+Rules  Standard:
+
+Automatic piece distribution
+
+Alternating turns
+
+Move validation
+
+Automatic detection of:
+
+Win
+
+Draw
+
+Clear interface showing:
+
+Player pieces
+
+Board
+
+Current turn
+
+Game currency balance
+
+🧑‍💻 Frontend (Mini App)
+
+Framework: React or Next.js
+
+Compatible with Base Mini Apps
+
+Features:
+
+Connect wallet
+
+Show ETH balance and game currency
+
+“Play” button (debits US$ 0.02 in ETH)
+
+Game screen
+
+Ranking screen
+
+Simple, mobile-first and optimized UI
+
+🔐 Security
+
+Transaction verification
+
+Double spend protection
+
+Move validation in the backend or smart contract
+
+Use of secure standards (OpenZeppelin)
+
+📦 Extras  Desirable Features
+
+Lightweight backend (Node.js) for matchmaking
+
+Match history
+
+On-chain event logs
+
+Ready for future expansion (NFTs, tournaments, sponsorships)
+
+📌 Expected Result
+
+Complete project structure
+
+Example code for:
+
+Smart contract
+
+Web3 integration
+
+Mini-app frontend
+
+Explanatory comments in the code
+
+Ready for deployment on Base Chain
+
+If you want, in the next step I can:
+
+🔹 Generate the smart contract in Solidity
+
+🔹 Create the mini-app frontend
+
+🔹 Adapt the prompt for Claude, GPT, or another AI
+
+🔹 Simplify for a quick MVP
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
